/**
 * @brief Construct and immediately solve the Poisson problem.
 *
 * The constructor:
 *   1. Builds eigenbases for Lx, Ly, Lz.
 *   2. Applies forward transform to f to obtain f̃.
 *   3. Solves diagonal system to obtain ũ.
 *   4. Applies inverse transform to obtain x (the output).
 *
 * Orientation of the boundaries is as follows.  The front and back boundaries have there first row agains the top,
 * and first column against the left.  The left and right boundaries each have their first row against the top, and
 * first column against the back.  The top and bottom boundaries each have their first row against the back
 * and first column against the left.
 *
 * Each pair of matrices that are stored together have the 2nd matrix of the pair stored beneath the first,
 * so when thought of as a single matrix with two submatrices, the first half of each column belongs to the first
 * sub matrix, and the second half of each column belongs to the second sub matrix.
 *
 * This constructor is meant to be run as a fortran method.
 *
 * @param frontBackPtr A pointer to the device front and back boundaries.  The back boundary matrix should be below the
 * front boundary matrix.  This will not be changed.
 * @param fbLd The leading dimension of the frontBack matrix.  The distance between the first element of each column.
 * @param leftRightPtr This will not be changed.
 * @param lrLd
 * @param topBottomPtr this will not be changed.
 * @param tbLd
 * @param xPtr Output buffer for the solution. No padding is permitted.
 * @param xStride The distance between elements of the output data.
 * @param height Height of the grid.
 * @param width Width of the grid.
 * @param depth Depth of the grid.
 * @param fPtr Right-hand-side of the Poisson equation (will be overwritten).  No padding is permitted.
 * @param fStride The distance between elements of the f vector.
 * @param rowsXRowsPtr A space to work in.  Will be changed.
