/**
 * @brief Represents a square matrix stored in banded (diagonal) format.
 *
 * Each stored column corresponds to a matrix diagonal. The @c _indices vector defines
 * which diagonal each column represents:
 *
 *  - @c 0  → main (primary) diagonal.
 *  - @c >0 → superdiagonals. The value is the column offset of the first element (row 0).
 *  - @c <0 → subdiagonals. The (absolute) value is the row offset of the first element (column 0).
 *
 * Internally, all diagonals have appended padding to match the length of the primary diagonal.
 * Padding elements hold unused values.
 *
 *There are two matrices here, the sparse matrix and the dense matrix.  The sparse matrix has only elements on the diagonals
 *in the indices vector.  The dense matrix's columns are the sparse matrices diagonals.  All inherited methods here
 *treat this matrix as the dense matrix.  Methods overwridden and implemented here treat this matrix as a sparse matrix.
 *
 * So for example, to set a diagonal of the sparse matrix one would call col(i).set(setTo).  The sparse diagonal at indices[i]
 * would then have values setTo.
 *
 * @tparam T Numeric type stored in the banded matrix.
 *
 * @note No implicit deep copying is performed. Underlying GPU memory is shared through
 *       @c std::shared_ptr. Destruction only frees memory when the final reference is released.
