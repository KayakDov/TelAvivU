/**
 * @brief Represents a square matrix stored in banded (diagonal) format.
 *
 * Each stored row corresponds to a matrix diagonal. The @c _indices vector defines
 * which diagonal each row represents:
 *
 *  - @c 0  → main (primary) diagonal.
 *  - @c >0 → superdiagonals. The value is the column offset of the first element (row 0).
 *  - @c <0 → subdiagonals. The value is the row offset of the first element (column 0).
 *
 * Internally, all diagonals have appended padding to match the length of the primary diagonal.
 * Padding elements hold unused values.
 *
 * @tparam T Numeric type stored in the banded matrix.
 *
 * @note No implicit deep copying is performed. Underlying GPU memory is shared through
 *       @c std::shared_ptr. Destruction only frees memory when the final reference is released.
